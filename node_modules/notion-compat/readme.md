# notion-compat

> A compatibility layer between the official Notion API and the unofficial Notion API

## Features

- fully compatible with `react-notion-x`
- backwards compatible with `notion-client` and the unofficial notion API

## Usage

```ts
import { Client } from '@notionhq/client'
import { NotionCompatAPI } from 'notion-compat'

const notion = new NotionCompatAPI(
  new Client({ auth: process.env.NOTION_TOKEN })
)

const recordMap = await notion.getPage(pageId)
```

The resulting `recordMap` is compatible with notion's unofficial API and react-notion-x.

## Demo

You can preview `react-notion-x` using the official client and compatibility layer here: https://react-notion-x-official-api-demo.transitivebullsh.it/

## Status

Currently, ~20 blocks have full compatibility and 8 have partial compatibility (sometimes in subtle ways) due Notion's official API not returning enough info for us to faithfully render them in all cases. See the block-by-block compatibility notes below for more info.

I recommend checking out [the notion-compat demo](https://react-notion-x-official-api-demo.transitivebullsh.it/) side-by-side with the [normal react-notion-x demo](https://react-notion-x-demo.transitivebullsh.it/) (which uses the unofficial Notion API via `notion-client`) and the [equivalent public notion page](https://transitive-bs.notion.site/Notion-Kit-Test-Suite-067dd719a912471ea9a3ac10710e7fdf).

Note that using the official API with `notion-compat` is quite a bit slower than using the unofficial API via `notion-client` because of [reasons](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x/issues/269#issuecomment-1100648873).

The main feature missing from `notion-compat` right now is collection (database) support. PRs welcome ðŸ˜ƒ
